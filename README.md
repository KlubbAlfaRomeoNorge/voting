# voting

Simple voting app for Google App Engine.

This is a simple voting app that lets anybody vote in online polls. A cookie is set when a vote is cast and the IP address of the voter's computer is saved to prevent accidental double votes.

Boostrap is used to style the voting page and there's very little help when administering the votes.

KARN uses this to conduct polls among the members -- all photos are (c) Alfa Romeo and grabbed from their press archive at [http://www.alfaromeopress.com/](http://www.alfaromeopress.com/).
